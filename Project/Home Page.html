<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This website is designed to help you learn CSS, starting with the basics and then building upon that. It will contain examples, images and videos to help with your learning and also contains a quiz to help you test your new knowledge.

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language used to add style to HTML websites. It makes the content much more aesthetically pleasing and allow the developer to create a much better experience for the user. </p>			<!--Paragraph-->

<h1>History</h1>			<!--Heading-->
<p>Work on CSS first began in 1994 when Håkon Wium Lie, who worked at CERN, found that as the usage of the Web was increasing there was no way to style a webpage. It was not actually a completely new idea, the concept of separate structure and layout had been part of Tim Berners-Lee's original plans in 1990 however it was incorporated into the browser he wrote. Website creators complained about the lack of choice over how their website looked so a new browser was created and Håkon published his idea of Cascading HTML Style Sheets. When the first implementations were shown as WWW conference in April 1995 web creators did not like the idea that the user could simply change how their website looked but the reader argued they should have the final say as to how the website should look.
<br><br>		<!--2 line breaks-->
The first version was released on December 17, 1996 and it had the ability to change font properties, text and background colours, positioning of text and images and several other features. CSS 2 was released less than 2 years later adding different positioning options, z-index and new font properties.
<br><br>
Work first started on CSS 3 around the same time that CSS 2 was released, the earliest drafts were first released in June 1999 but was first properly released in 2005. CSS 3 split into several modules and each module would add new features. Due to this different modules have been updated more recently so are more stable and have different statuses.
